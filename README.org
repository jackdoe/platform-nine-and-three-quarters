<h3>it is not easy</h3>

#+END_HTML

I am writing this for my wife Gergana and I am trying to make it
useful for her, so I am perfectly fine if you (who is reading this tutorial and
is not Gergana) do not like it.

This is not really a tutorial, just trying to relate very basic language constructs to programming,
so it will feel a bit like the picture above, but fear not, after grinding for a while you will draw a panda.

I promise you if you master only 4 things you will be able to climb the learning curve.

Keep in mind that the learning curve is not really a curve, but rather
a learning staircase, once you learn a concept it does not get easy right away, but after quite some tinkering.

The four things you have to master are:

 * understand the meaning of the word 'if'
 * repetition (or looping)
 * variables
 * goto

This now sounds very abstract and useless, but by the end of the
course you will be able to write some useful programs.

 * fun math game for Bella
 * trip budget planner
 * tick tack toe game
 * app that keeps track of how long Bella plays on the iPad
 * dog walk calendar
 * food tracking app


At first we will start by understanding the very basic concepts, and
then you will have to memorize some syntax, which will seem like magic
spells, and this is fine.

Our goal is to replace most of the magic incantations with physics
understanding, in general the way new concepts will be introduced are
magic first - physics later.

For example when Bella asks me why do soap bubbles have colorful
rings, I simply tell her: because of light, when you grow up you will
have to spend some time figuring it out; instead of trying to explain
quantum interference.


The most important thing is to not give up and understand that it is
simply difficult and it is difficult to anybody who is just starting.

It might also help you to translate this text to Dutch, I think this
will help you to memorize the incantations better.

There are hundreds of books, each is trying to teach from different
approach, but I belive this is the best way for you, so sit back,
relax and try to not close the laptop in despair.


While you are reading this keep playing [CodeCombat](https://CodeCombat.com), whenever you go to a point you cant pass, restart the game and keep trying.


* foundation

* language [ WIP ]

Even though we have been together for 18 years now, sometimes when we
talk I still dont know what you mean and vice versa.

#+begin_src
The weather is heavy today.
#+end_src

| weather | The state of the atmosphere at a particular |
|         | place and time as regards heat, cloudiness, |
|         | dryness, sunshine, wind, rain, etc.         |
|         |                                             |
| heavy   | Of great weight; difficult to lift or move. |
|         |                                             |
| today   | On or in the course of this present day.    |

~heavy weather~ is something we say and most people know what we mean
when we say it, but when we lookup the definitions it makes no sense.

Now when i say ~heavy weather~ I am not absolutely sure that the other person will understand me,


* if

#+begin_src
    If you eat your meal, you can have icecream for desert.
#+end_src

doesnt seem difficult, and it translates to something like

#+begin_src
    if (Bella eats her meal)
        she can have icecream
    else
        no icecream
    end
#+end_src

another example:

#+begin_src
    If it is not raining, we will go to the sea
#+end_src

code:

#+begin_src
    if (not raining)
        go to sea
    else
        stay at home
    end
#+end_src

read it again *until* you can come up with at least 5 examples,
write the examples in the format:

#+begin_src
    sentence in english
    code
#+end_src

send me the examples to my email (jack@sofialondonmoskva.com)
there is a lot of syntax involved here, so lets break it down

    if [something that is either true or false]
        code block executed if it is true
        the code block can be multiple lines
    else
        code executed if it is false
        this code block can also be multiple lines
    end

there are many ways to declare a code block some examples:

#+begin_src
    if (not raining) {
       go to sea
    } else {
       stay at home
    }
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src
    if not raining:
       go to sea
    else:
       stay at home
#+end_src

And there are many more, so when you read code you have to learn to
just look for the ~code blocks~ doesnt matter if the language you are
reading has brackets or spaces or semicolons or square brackets etc.

The point I am trying to make is that it is very easy to get scared
when you look at any example code because it is full of weird symbols,
for example:

#+begin_src
    if (!raining) {
       go_to_sea();
    } else {
       stay_at_home();
    }
#+end_src


there is ~! () { } ; and _~.

~!~ means ~not~ literally ~!raining~ means ~not raining~, ~()~ are used to
group the if condition, and ~{}~ are defining the code block, ~;~ is
saying somewhat equivalent to "end of sentence"

Keep in mind that syntax is absolutely irrelevant the point is in the
~condition~ and ~code block~


** conditions

Lets expand on the concept of ~condition~ and examine the following piece of code:

#+begin_src
    if (water temperature == 100)
        remove from stove
        pour in cup
        put tea in
    end
#+end_src

in this case the condition is ~(water temperature == 100)~ and if this statement is ~true~ then the code block will be executed

#+begin_src
    if true
       code
    else
       code
    end
#+end_src

This is very important and now it seems super abstract, but I will say
again, *all* programs can be reduced to a ~if~ and ~goto~, goto means
*go to specific part in the program*, so if you understand the ~if~
(called ~branching~), you are half there.

You are probably annoyed by now, using such trivial examples and you
absolutely do not belive that this is how programs are made, but they
are.

The whole point of the ~condition~ is that the computer will
*evaluate* it to check if it results in ~true~ or ~false~ for using
our previous example, lets say the water temperature at the moment is
~57~ degrees, so the evaluation of ~(water temperature == 100)~ is *false*.

Lets say we run our programs few minutes later, and at this point the water temperature is 100 degrees, then ~(water temperature == 100)~ is *true*.

The code is absolutely the same, but somehow it works in a different way.
A program being simply set of instructions, this is how we change the
*flow* of it, to behave differently when the *state*
changes, in our case the state is the temperature of the water.

We can have millions of lines of code in ~if (water temperature == 100) .... end~, but unless the water temperature reaches 100 degrees
it is completely irrelevant and never executed.


** code block

code block is just a collection of statements that are executed one after the other, nothing fancy.


* goto

~goto~ is a way to go to specific point in the program, for example if
we dont want to be running our water temperature program every few
minutes by hand, it is very nice to tell the computer to try and check
the temperature again if it not 100 degrees:

#+begin_src
    CHECK_WATER:
        if (water temperature == 100)
            remove from stove
            pour in cup
            put tea in
        else
            goto CHECK_WATER
        end
#+end_src

If you are confused by this, its ok, we will keep using it in the
sections below, and hopefully it will be clear at some point.


* loops

#+begin_src
    you can not play outside, until you finish your homework
#+end_src

same as

#+begin_src
    until homework finished
        no play
    end
    let her play outside
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src
    while not (homework finished)
        no play
    end
    let her play outside
#+end_src

another example is right in the previous section:

#+begin_src
    read it again until you can come up with at least 5 examples,

    until (you can think of 5 examples)
        read the #if section
    end
    read the next section
#+end_src

* infinite loops

while(or until) loop syntax is ~while [condition is true]~, so we can simply do ~while 1 == 1~, or ~while true~


* breaking out of the loop
#+begin_src
    you can play outside after 4 o'clock
#+end_src
so of course she will be super excited and just watch the clock all the time, so this will translate to
#+begin_src
    while true
        if clock == 4pm
            break out of the loop
        end
    end

    play outside :)
#+end_src

* variables

#+begin_src
    lets flip a coin to decide which pizza to order, heads is dominos and tails is newyorkpizza
#+end_src

variables are simply placeholders, their name is irrelevant, we only care about their value

#+begin_src
    order_from = dont know yet
    coin_result = flip coin
    if (coin_result == heads)
        order_from = dominos
    else
        order_from = newyorkpizza
    end
#+end_src

in this example we used 2 variables ~order_from~ and ~coin_result~, in coin_result we simply hold the vaule of the actual coin flip

you can think of a variable as a ~box~ with a label, the label of the box is the *name* of the variable, the content of the box is its *value*

* variables with loops

now this is very of cool

#+begin_src
    with this shampoo you have to wash your hair 5 times, each time put shamoo, wait 3 minutes and rince
#+end_src

so using variables and loops we can do
#+begin_src
    number_of_times = 0
    while number_of_times < 5

        put shampoo
        wait 3 minutes
        rince

        number_of_times = number_of_times + 1
    end
    get out of the bathroom

the computer executes that as follow
#+begin_src
    set number_of_times to 0
    LOOP: is number_of_times < 5
    if yes
        put shampoo
        wait 3 minutes
        rince

        number_of_times = number_of_times + 1
        goto LOOP
    end

    get out of the bathroom
#+end_src

so you can see just as it is about to continue with the program we
~goto~ the loop beginning and check if the condition is still valid

in many languages there is syntactic suggar for this kind of loops,
called ~for~ loop, and for ~x = x + 1~, called incrementing a
variable, to be written as ~x++~

the syntax is something like:
#+begin_src
    for [initial configuration]; [while condition is true]; [do this on each iteration]
#+end_src
in our case this looks like:
#+begin_src
    for number_of_items = 0; number_of_items < 5; number_of_items++
        put shampoo
        wait 3 minutes
        rince
    end
    get out of the bathroom
#+end_src
well.. in most language each of the ~for~ parameters is optional :) so you can have
#+begin_src
    number_of_items = 0
    for ; number_of_items < 5; number_of_items++
        put shampoo
        wait 3 minutes
        rince
    end
    get out of the bathroom
#+end_src
or
#+begin_src
    number_of_items = 0
    for ; number_of_items < 5 ;
        put shampoo
        wait 3 minutes
        rince
        number_of_items++
    end
    get out of the bathroom
#+end_src
wait.. this looks the same as the while loop; yes, yes it does.

we can also use inifinite loop and break out of it
#+begin_src
    number_of_items = 0
    for ;; [same as while 1=1, or while true]
        put shampoo
        wait 3 minutes
        rince
        number_of_items++
        if (number_of_items >= 5)
            break from the loop
        end
    end
    get out of the bathroom
#+end_src
now.. to the core of all cores, the basic of all basics:


* loops are just syntactic suggar for ~if~ and ~goto~


#+begin_src
    number_of_items = 0
    LOOP: if (number_of_items < 5)
            put shampoo
            wait 3 minutes
            rince

            number_of_items++
            goto LOOP
          end

    get out of the bathroom

#+end_src

if you can get past this point, you can be called a programmer

* functions

Functions are a piece of code that you can call whenever you want, some functions take parameters, some not.
Lets use our water boiling example:
#+begin_src
     if (water temperature == 100)
         remove from stove
         pour in cup
         put tea in
     end
#+end_src

You can imagine that checking the water temperature is quite tricky,
well it is easy if it is boiling :) but not so easy if it is not, so
lets write a simple function to check the temperature:

#+begin_src
    function get_water_temperature
       get termometer
       put in pod
       read the termometer value
       return (the termometer value to whoever wants to know the temperature)
    end
#+end_src
the *return* part is where you should focus on, there are functions
that do not return anything, but this is not the case here, we need
the *output* of the function to do something with it.

and now I will rewrite the example to use our nice function:
#+begin_src
     if (get_water_temperature() == 100)
         remove from stove
         pour in cup
         put tea in
     end
#+end_src
I silently added a new notation of ~function_name()~ which is usually
used when a function is ~called~. Then we check if the ~result of the
function is equal to 100~.


Some functions take parameters, for example we can make a
~put_tea_in()~ function that needs 2 parameters, a kind of tea, and
which cup to put the tea in:
#+begin_src
    function put_tea_in(which_tea, which_cup)
        find specific tea(which_tea)
        unpack tea pack
        put in cup
    end
#+end_src
this function does not return anything, but it ~modifies the world~, this is usually the case with functions that dont return anything, otherwise they are quite _useless_.

another example of function with parameters
#+begin_src
    function multiplication(a, b)
        return a * b
    end
#+end_src
we call the function in the same way as ~get_water_temperature()~, but
we add the parameters inside the ~()~ like so: ~put_tea_in(green tea,
pink cup)~

or if we want to do multiplication:
#+begin_src
    if (multiplication(5,10) == 50)
        remove from stove
        pour in cup
        put_tea_in(green tea, pink cup)
    end
#+end_src
Well this example was silly, lets make a more useful one:
#+begin_src
    if (get_water_temperature() == multiplication(10,10)
        remove from stove
        pour in pink cup

        put_tea_in(green tea, pink cup)
    end
#+end_src
or
#+begin_src
    if (multiplication(get_water_temperature(), 10) == 1000)
        remove from stove
        pour in pink cup

        put_tea_in(green tea, pink cup)
    end
#+end_src
haha both are not very useful :) but I want to illustrate how we can
chain call functions, and now that I have written this I think we can
get a better example
